# There is two main part in this project the first one in a simulation one:
SIM_UR5

This repository contains a temporary simulation environment for testing and developing robot control algorithms using the UR5e robot model in a MuJoCo physics simulation.
The simulation environment provides a simplified setup for:
- UR5e robot arm simulation
- Basic pick and place operations
- Motion planning and execution
- Block manipulation tasks


# the second one is the implmentation and adaptation of the code to real life robot in the lab 
LAB_UR5
- 2 real robot arm
- basics operation
- capability to work one with an other

# ENJOY the videos demonstration or test the code yourself 
AIR_VIDEOS
